# Open Mechanical AI

An open-source project to build the worldâ€™s first AI-powered Mechanical Engineering Knowledge Base â€” fueled by community contributions, validated by AI systems, and accessible to every engineer worldwide.

---

## Project Mission

Mechanical engineering knowledge is vast, practical, and often locked in textbooks, workplaces, and the minds of experts.  
We aim to democratize this knowledge by:

- Collecting real-world mechanical engineering insights, formulas, standards, and practices.
- Validating them with AI and peer reviews to ensure credibility.
- Training a conversational AI assistant that helps engineers solve practical problems instantly.

**Empower every engineer to innovate with confidence â€” without barriers, without hierarchy.**

## What This Project Does

- Collects mechanical engineering knowledge across domains:
  - Materials Engineering
  - Mechanical Design
  - Manufacturing Processes
  - Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics
  - Failure Analysis
  - Standards (ASME, ISO, BIS, etc.)
- Validates contributions using AI models + peer review.
- Builds an evolving, credible database of mechanical engineering knowledge.
- Fine-tunes an open-source AI model (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA) to serve engineers globally.
